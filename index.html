<p>The Checkers Tutor has two purposes.  First is to be a challenging but beatable opponent for checkers players of any level, from novice to expert.  It will dynamically adjust itself to match the skill of the player.  Second is to help players get better.  It will do this by finding moments in the game where players could make a better move by looking just a little further ahead. 
Behind the scenes, the tutor uses a min-max algorithm with iterative deepening to find the best moves while looking a varying number of moves ahead.  By comparing these best moves with the moves made by the player, the tutor can figure out how far ahead the player looks while playing.  The goal is to increase this look-ahead until the beginner is playing at a respectable level.</p>

<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h3>

<p>Checkers is often considered a simple game, and people miss the strategic element.  By improving players' ability to think through moves and plan ahead, checkers can become a satisfying mental challenge and an enjoyable, deep competition.</p>
